            Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven, but can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked. Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their center. I love backing as it gives you infinite possibilities do whatever you like. Another thing i like about it, is that you get to create something from just a bunch of ingredeints and end up with something totally different!
